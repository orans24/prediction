Prediction is ipynb file that suits for google Colab notebook. When running the file, you will see the GUI base on juypter widgets for running predictions for the stocks market.
 The prediction is calculating by sequel model of Keras(Tensorflow) with LSTM layers. Base on the last 25 days thatâ€™s the model get by API from Yahoo Finance the model predicts 10 days into the future and present the price, momentum and trend of each stock you choose to predict. In addition, there is another option that advise and rate the stocks you choose to predict. For example, you choose 10 stocks to predict then you can use the advice bottom to take the best x stocks of them. The advice uses another model that base on LSTM and predict the MSE of the first model base on the last 25 days. The advice search for the highest predicted change and the smallest MSE and then base on both choose the best stocks.  For running the notebook, you need nothing but google Colab.
